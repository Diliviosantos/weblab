A Dark Theme Toggle button has been added to the website header. 

The button listens for click events using JavaScript (script.js).

Each click toggles a data-theme="dark" attribute on the <body> element.

When the dark theme is active, styles from styles.css targeting [data-theme="dark"] are applied.

Clicking the button again switches back to the default (light) theme.
